    <h1>My Favorite Restaurants in Saipan</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I lived in Saipan for most of my life and to live is to eat and where are we eating? Well let me introduce to
        you
        to some of favorite restaurants. Whether your craving for some island classics, perhaps something ready to
        go, or maybe you're in the mood for some Italian-Inspired cuisine&#8212Saipan has got it all! </p>

      <h2>Top 3 Places to Dine</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Himawari</li>
        <li>Shirley's Coffee Shop</li>
        <li>The Angry Penne</li>
      </ol>

        <h3>Himawari <small>| Garapan, Saipan </small></h3>
      </div>
      <div class="img-row">
        <img src="images/bento.jpg" alt="assorted bento boxes">
        <img src="images/bread.jpg" alt="assorted baked goods">
      </div>

        <p>Himawari is one of my go to places when it comes to food. They provide baked goods, ready to eat bento, and
        there is even a hotel! (and also a convenience store) If you're in a rush Himawari is a great place to grab some
        sushi, drinks, and maybe a donut while you're at it. The only thing that you should be wary off is getting there
        at a reasonable time so that you have a better selection of bento's and watch out for the parking because it is
        busy! </p>

      <h4>Must Try:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Seared Salmon Ikura Bowl</li>
        <li>Blueberry Cream Bread</li>
        <li>Tempura Zaru Udon</li>
      </ul>
